These services rely on a combination of technologies, including Global Positioning System (GPS), Wi-Fi, cellular networks, and sensors, to determine a user's position accurately.\nNOTE: Can cause bootloops on some devices.\nThe primary goal of LBS is to offer personalized and context-aware experiences based on a user's geographical location. This can include services like:\n1. Navigation and Mapping, 2. Location-Based Advertising, 3. Social Networking, 4. Emergency Services, 5.
