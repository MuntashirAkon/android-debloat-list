# Welcome!

This website acts as a front-end for the [Android Debloat List](https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/android-debloat-list) (ADL) project and is intended to serve as an always available wiki for the pre-installed applications on Android, commonly known as "bloatware". You can utilize the search button or the sidebar to navigate through the bloatware (requires JavaScript), or you can just append `/bloatware/<package-name>.html` to the homepage URL to navigate to the desired bloatware if available. Each page also has an "Open in App Manager" link that you can follow to view the app info of the selected app (if installed).

## Alternative  Front-ends

Here's a list of alternative front-ends that make use of the ADL project:
